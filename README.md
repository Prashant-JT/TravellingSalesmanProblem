# Travelling Salesman Problem
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) answers the following question: given a list of cities and the distances between each pair Of these, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and when finished returns to the origin city? This is an NP-Hard problem within combinatorial optimization, very important in operations research and in computer science. The problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most studied optimization problems. It is used as a test for many optimization methods. Although the problem is computationally complex, a large number of exact heuristics and methods are known, so that some instances from one hundred to thousands of cities can be solved.

The TSP has various applications even in its simplest formulation, such as: planning, logistics and in the manufacture of electronic circuits. Slightly modified, it appears as: a sub-problem in many areas, such as in the DNA sequence. In this application, the concept of “city” represents, for example: customers, welding points, or DNA fragments, and the concept of “distance” represents travel time or cost, or a measure of similarity between DNA fragments. In many applications, additional restrictions like resource limit or time windows make the problem considerably difficult. The TSP is a special case of Traveling Purchaser Problem.

In computational complexity theory, the decision version of the TSP (where, given a big "L", the task is to decide which graph has a path less than L) belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Therefore, in the worst case, the execution time for any algorithm that solves the TSP is likely to increase exponentially with respect to the number of cities.
